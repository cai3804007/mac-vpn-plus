Your Privacy Matters

Last modified: June 1, 2020

When you use VPN Plus, you trust us with your information. This document is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. 

Though VPN Plus provides anonymous service and does not require any form of account information, we hope you read it carefully and do agree with the policy to continue use our service.

Two kinds of information will be collected in an established VPN session:

	•	Your real IPv4 address
	•	The inbound and outbound data transferred during a session

Your real IPv4 address (in the form of a.b.c.d) will be kept on VPN server from the start of a session, and deleted in both memory and file system at the end of a session. We never log your network activities on the server side.

The data transferred is computed realtime and shown up on the user interface. This information is to help you measure the speed and stability. In future revision, the app may limit your bandwidth automatically when you abuse our service. 

Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities

We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks, including the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.

Changes

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.
