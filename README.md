### VPN Plus is enterprise VPN

Starting from macOS 10.11, Apple allows third party developers to build more powerful VPN solution than the traditional “Personal VPN” solutions including L2TP, Cisco IPSec and IKEv2.

Apple calls this technology Enterprise VPN, or Network Extension Tunnel Provider.

VPN Plus is such kind of thing. It defines its own protocol, and makes VPN faster and more secure.


### Protect online privacy

Using VPN (virtual private network) technology, all user data can be encrypted, including web browsing in any browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc), file download, email, chat, game, online banking service, and so on.

Your IP address is also changed when VPN is turned on. This gives you additional protection against geo-location trackers.


### Avoid being monitored by WiFi hotspots

Most WiFi routers have the capability to analysing user traffic, for example, which site you are accessing right now, how many minutes you spend every day on a particular web service.

VPN Plus can not only encrypt your traffic, but also hide everything about your online activities as well. 


# Get more contents

As you may know many services are only available to domestic users. Even though you are subscriber of such  service, you will not be able to access those contents when you are abroad.

With VPN Plus, you can virtually come back, and thus get those contents without restriction.

Also you can get more contents hosting in foreign countries.


### VPN using Personal VPN technology

We also build another macOS VPN app based on personal VPN technology. 

If you would like to experience the difference, take a look at this one:
